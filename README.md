#### **Problem Statement -** 
*From classrooms to corporate offices, digital devices have become inseparable from our lives. But behind the convenience lies a hidden cost: declining concentration, increasing stress, and unhealthy screen dependency. The challenge is clear — how can we transform technology from a source of burnout into a companion for wellness?* 

**Sol/Methodology -** 
*The proposed system collects digital usage and behavioral data such as screen time and engagement patterns, which are then cleaned and analyzed to extract meaningful wellness signals. A GenAI-powered model classifies users into five risk levels—Healthy, Mild, Moderate, High, and Critical—based on their digital behavior. These risk levels are mapped to intuitive, gamified roles to improve user understanding and engagement. A personalized recommendation engine then delivers wellness challenges tailored to each user’s profile. Finally, a feedback loop continuously adapts recommendations based on user behavior, promoting long-term digital well-being.*


#### **How will it be able to solve the problem?**

**Ans -** *The proposed system tackles digital well-being challenges by detecting unhealthy usage patterns early using GenAI-driven behavioral analysis. It delivers timely, personalized interventions by classifying users into meaningful risk levels, rather than imposing one-size-fits-all limits. Through gamified wellness challenges, the system encourages gradual and positive behavior change instead of strict control. A continuous feedback loop adapts recommendations as users evolve, helping them build sustainable digital habits. Overall, the solution shifts digital wellness from short-term restriction to long-term awareness, self-regulation, and healthy balance.*

#### **Future Development -**
*This work represents only the first step toward a broader digital wellness ecosystem. Future development will focus on collecting richer behavioral datasets to further enhance personalization and improve risk assessment accuracy. The platform will be expanded with advanced gamification features such as diverse challenge types, progress tracking, leaderboards, and reward mechanisms to sustain long-term user engagement. Additionally, integration with wearable devices and smartphone wellness APIs will enable real-time detection of stress and fatigue, allowing proactive and timely interventions. On the AI front, future efforts will involve fine-tuning generative models to deliver safer, more empathetic, and emotionally aware recommendations. Finally, the system will be scaled for deployment across schools, universities, and workplaces, promoting healthier and more balanced digital habits at a larger societal level.*
